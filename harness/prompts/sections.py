"""Static prompt section templates.

Identity follows mature agents (Claude Code / OpenHands): a thin product
persona + role boundaries. Coding workflow (Resolve→Act→Close) lives in
execution *modes* (`config/modes.json`), not in a fixed "you are a coding
agent" identity — so research / ask / plan tasks are first-class.

        "resolve from context, ask 1–3 specific questions in plain text and "

        "shell comments, URLs, or intent text (no assume X / if it means Y).\n"

        "Long product-spec clarification is via load_skill(requirements-clarity).\n"
        "5. Prefer delivering an answer once tool results suffice; do not keep "
        "fetching to pad evidence.\n"
        "6. After you ask a clarifying question, the user's next short reply is "
